%% Soft robots are useful, but difficult to control

%% Various control methods have been applied, with certain shortcomings of each

%% Koopman Opertator Theory offers a method for using linear control methods for nonlinear systems
%% This is different than the typical approach which involves linearizing about setpoints

%% Furthermore, Koopman theory can be used to construct models purely from data (cite ICRA paper), eliminating the need for physics-based modeling

%% In this paper, we use Koopman Operator Theory to model and control a soft robot arm using linear control methods such as state-feedback, LQR, and MPC.
